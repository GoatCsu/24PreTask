#### AI Generation
第15·
1. Autoregressive Generation : Step by Step : Context
2. Non-Autogressive Generation : Parallel Operation : Photograph
   - Quality issue
3. Change the Possibility of the word
4. ***Combination***
   1. AR : some concise context
   2. NAR : Add more detais to it
   3. Same as Encoder Decoder
   - Autoregressive compress and the AI learns the embedding
   4. Diffusion masks low quality pixel
   5. Multi-NAR generate the photos more efficiently
## Speculative Decoding
1. Faster: Predictor and Validation Process
   1. Compare the calculate one with the predict one
   2. If Pr is fake, ignore the later one
   3. Even worse, we can at least output one 
- NAR: Predictor
-  Compress Model: Distilling
- AR: Validation Process
